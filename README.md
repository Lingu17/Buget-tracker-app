ðŸ’° Budget Tracker: Financial Control Center
GitHub Description: A modern, responsive budget tracking application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to simplify personal finance. Log transactions, set limits, and visualize your spending in real-time.

About the Project
This is a personal financial management tool designed for simplicity and clarity. The Budget Tracker allows users to quickly log income (positive amount) and expenses (negative amount), providing an instant update to their total balance. The application showcases a dynamic, single-page interface with a striking dark/neon-green theme.

This project serves as a strong portfolio piece demonstrating proficiency in front-end development using vanilla JavaScript for core functionality and DOM manipulation.
